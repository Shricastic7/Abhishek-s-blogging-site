                        <p>There is no doubt in this that a water bottle is one of the essential things to carry while trekking. During the hike, the body needs to be kept hydrated throughout the time as at the altitudes it is difficult to find places for water. The only source to find water at this height are the natural streams. While passing through these natural streams one can refill their bottle to keep them hydrated. It will be good to avoid carrying plastic bottles and rather invest in a sturdy water bottle which does not leak.</p>
